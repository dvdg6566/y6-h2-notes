# My Y6 H2 Notes

Hi! 

I'm Daniel and here are my Y6 H2 A-level notes. 

Hope this can help some future A-level students with their preparation.

Warning: I didn't even get A for my Preliminary Examination for General Paper, so use at your discretion.

[Physics and non-organic Chemistry notes are done in latex]
